# My Dotfiles

Here is my config [WIP] for the following setup
- Hyprland
- nvim
- tmux
- fish shell (yes I messed up for this one)
- dunst
- kitty
- kanata
- neofetch


If you want to apply my config to your env you need the following package:
```
gnu-stow
```

To copy the config first clone the repo, do at the root of it and simply do: 
```
stow .
```
